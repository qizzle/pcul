# Pay for Commercial Use License (PCUL)

My attempt at creating a business-oriented license. Use at your own risk.

## Quick Overview

- Free for private and non-commercial use.
- For any commercial use, a license fee must be paid to the original developer.
- No reselling of the base software.
- Any modifications to the software must be released under the same license terms.
- Developers must be credited unless a commercial license is obtained.
- Includes Disclaimer of Warranty, Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, and clauses that survive termination of the license.

Please read the full license before using.

## Use Cases

Use this license if you wish to restrict commercial usage of your software while still allowing access to the source code. It is not an open-source license and will not become one.
